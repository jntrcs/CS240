# CS240
Two years ago I took BYU's CS 240 Advanced Programming Concepts class. Four of the projects we worked on for that class are included here.

Evil Hangman: A game of hangman that intelligently adapts by changing the word away from the letters the user guesses.

Photoshop: A program that can do simple transformations on image files (black and white, invert, etc)

Auto Correct: A program that can take an input string and suggest a correct spelling of the word by adding, removing, changing, or swapping characters.

Super Asteroids: an Android game that allows you to control a ship, fly around a map, and shoot at asteroids as they travel through space.

This git repository was made after letting these files sit untouched for over a year, so no guarentee is made that they're in working condition.
